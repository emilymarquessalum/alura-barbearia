# Alura-Barbearia
  

## About

This site comes from Alura's course of HTML and CSS, but with many visual modifications. 
I personally like to keep my public repositories with only authentic work and, although the base structure was built within the course, I believe this page deserves a place in my public projects!

### Color Pallete
I used a color pallete selection program, with the objective of having a design direction to follow. I am not a designer, and the objective was to be capable of delivering a design consistently, and I did my best to achieve that.
All the colors from the page used the pallete added in the css file through variables, giving preference to main styles and using subtle modified versions in most other cases. I also defined three exception colors to give specialemphasis to some specific parts.

### Privacy policy

Inpired by a LGPD course that I was doing simultaneously, I decided to create on my own a section for the pages privacy policy. It covers the utilization of the data from the contact form, using  Ela cobre a utilização dos dados do usuário no formulário de contato, using customized stylization that gives different ammounts of emphasis to the information, I also added a link to follow related sections, and it even has a button that allows the user to copy paste the raw content (it takes away parts of the text that make sense only for site navigation, such as cited link).  
 

## Externals
- [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) -> Added as an easy way to implement a button that would copy raw content from the privacy policy.


## File structure
The file structure of this project is really simple. The folders are:
- styles: .css files
- behaviour: .js files
- res: resources (images and etc)
